"""The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N
non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard. Write a
program that solves the N queens problem.

- Usage: nqueens N
    If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments, print Usage: nqueens N, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
 
- where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4
    - If N is not an integer, print N must be a number, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
    - If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at least 4, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1

- Format: [[r, c], [r, c], [r, c], [r, c]]
where `r` and `c` represent the row and column, respectively, where a
queen must be placed on the chessboard.
